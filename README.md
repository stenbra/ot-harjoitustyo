# Turnbased roshambo like fighting game
The project is a pygame project. The game is a strategic card game where you try to predict the opponents moves and play your cards accordingly (kindof like roshambo). Players have health and when it reaches zero, then its over. Score will be calculated based on the performance and can be viewed on a scoreboard
